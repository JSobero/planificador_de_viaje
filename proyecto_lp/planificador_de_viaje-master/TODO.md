# TODO: Complete Travel Planner Project with FP and LP

## 1. Update requirements.txt
- Add pyDatalog for logic programming support. ✅

## 2. Refactor logic.py
- Make all functions pure and immutable (use tuples for paths). ✅
- Add logic programming rules using pyDatalog for smarter recommendations based on constraints (budget, distance, CO2). ✅

## 3. Update app.py
- Import and use functions from logic.py. ✅
- Remove duplicated logic functions from app.py. ✅
- Ensure the app uses deterministic logic instead of random. ✅

## 4. Test the application
- Install dependencies and run the Flask app to verify recommendations work with FP and LP paradigms.
- Note: Python/pip not available in current environment; user needs to install dependencies manually.
